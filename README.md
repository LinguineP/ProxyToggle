# ProxyToggle

ProxyToggle is a Windows tray application for toggling system proxy settings. It provides quick access to enable/disable proxy, edit proxy settings, and runs in the background with a tray icon that reflects the current proxy state.

`Going into settings was to annoying to do every time, and didnt care for keyboard shorcuts like maybe autohothey so I made this, because proxy in the office was annoying,(I tried autodetect, was very unreliable)`
